# Design Patterns in Swift

This repository is part of the [Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

It contains Swift examples for all classic GoF design patterns.

Each pattern includes two examples:

- **Structural** examples show the internal structure of patterns, including detailed comments.

- **RealWorld** examples show how patterns can be used in real-world Swift applications.

## Requirements

For the best experience, we recommend working with examples with [Swift 4](https://github.com/apple/swift) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) IDE.


## Usage

Each example is included into own Unit Test Target.

Select an appropriate scheme in Xcode and press `Cmd + U` to run it.


## FAQ

#### 1. What is the _Client Code_?

_Client_ means _client of classes, defined as part of a pattern_, which is merely a caller of the given methods or a user of the given classes. In other words, it's the part of your application's code that uses the pattern's classes.

#### 2. I don't understand the roles you're referring to in RealWorld examples.

Take a look at the structural example first. There you'll find detailed descriptions of each class in a pattern, its role, and connection to other classes.
