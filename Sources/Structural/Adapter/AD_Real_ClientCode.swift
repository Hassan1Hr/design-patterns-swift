/// Adapter Design Pattern
///
/// Intent: Convert the interface of a class into the interface clients expect.
/// Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't work otherwise because of
/// incompatible interfaces.

    /// Example.
    /// Let's assume that our app perfectly works with Facebook authorization.
    /// However, users ask you to add sign in via Twitter.
    ///
    /// Unfortunately, Twitter SDK has a different authorization method.
    ///
    /// Firstly, you have to create the new protocol 'AuthService'
    /// and insert the authorization method of Facebook SDK.
    ///
    /// Secondly, write an extension for Twitter SDK and implement methods
    /// of AuthService protocol, just a simple redirect.
    ///
    /// Thirdly, write an extension for Facebook SDK.
    /// You should not write any code at this point as methods
    /// already implemented by Facebook SDK.
    ///
    /// It just tells a compiler that both SDKs have the same interface.
